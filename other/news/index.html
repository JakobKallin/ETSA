                <p>Ah yes, a joyous new anthem for every occasion. It really seems to connect, at least to the 7 people who have heard it so far. I suppose it requires a certain sense of humor. This, of course, is consistent with my tendency to overestimate the intelligence of our audience.</p>
                <p>Over the last couple years of playing live, I've taken to introducing "Black Gold" &amp; "Lately" as commentaries on the Bush Sr. &amp; Jr. eras, respectively, as Parts 1 &amp; 2 of a trilogy that I hoped I would never have to finish. This is Part 3.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it's been a good summer. On behalf of the band, many thanks to you and anyone who has helped make it so. Your support, as always, is invaluable and humbling.</p>
                <p>Let's all learn to live in peace and two or three-part harmony!</p>
                <p>Good luck,</p>
