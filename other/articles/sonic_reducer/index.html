<p class="intro">Soul Asylum guitarist Dan Murphy assesses his band's rocky recording career
with disarming candor.</p>

<h2>Say What You Will (Twin/Tone, 1984)</h2>
<p>"People think that we must have been very excited about getting signed to
A&amp;M or Columbia records, but what was really exciting was getting signed to
Twin/Tone, because we were 20 year old kids.  We were terrified to be in the
studio making our first record.  As a result, we were very self-conscious
and afraid to let our guard down, so everything sounds really rigid.  In the
final analysis, Say What You Will has a lot of attitude and not a lot of
content, which is a bad combination.  Believe it or not, we actually
performed one of the songs 'Stranger' on MTV Unplugged.  That's an amazing
song with one of the best lyrics Dave has ever written".</p>

<h2>Made to be Broken (Twin/Tone, 1986)</h2>
<p>"Made to be Broken was an ambitious record, and recording it represented a
huge growing process for the band.  We were really happy with the way it
came out, and I think that Bob Mould did a really good job producing us -
the record sounds a whole lot better than we did as a band.  'Tied to the
Tracks' and 'Can't go Back' are really great songs.</p>

<p>"Dave was really into us being an art band back then - songs like 'Whoa!'
had 'art breaks', which is what we called it when we made a lot of weird
noise.  Dave would say 'Then we'll have a two bar art break'.  None of us
knew any music theory, so we would answer, 'Just tell us when the two bars
are up'.  I wouldn't mind learning 'Whoa!' again because I think it has a
great guitar riff.  And you'll have to excuse me for sounding snotty, but I
think that I've heard that riff turn up in some other band's song over the
years"</p>

<h2>While You Were Out  (Twin/Tone, 1986)</h2>
<p>"There was only a seven-month gap between the making of Made to be Broken
and While You Were Out, and we were on tour the whole time.  I don't think
that the band was sonically or emotionally ready to make that record, and we
were all pretty disappointed with the way it came out.  I remember being on
tour in Europe about a year-and-a-half later, when the record had just come
out over there.  People would play it at these little parties that we'd go
to and we would be thinking, 'Oh God, this record is terrible'.</p>

<p>'Closer to the Stars' is one of the most poignant songs Dave's ever written.
I'm just embarrassed at how badly we recorded and played it - it really
sounds like pure shit.  It's ironic and sad, because if that songs was on
Let Your Dim Light Shine and was well performed  and recorded, it would
probably be our lead-off track.  There are a couple of other good songs on
there as well:  'Freaks', 'Never too Soon' and 'Passing Sad Daydream'- which
we still play sometimes- come to mind'.</p>

<h2>Hangtime (A&amp;M, 1988)</h2>
<p>"Hangtime was our first album for a major label and our first album with a
major budget.  I think we spent $100,000 on it, which in those days was a
lot.  We were working with Ed Stasium and (ex-Patti Smith guitarist] Lenny
kaye, and we were intimidated as hell because Ed had produced Ramones
records and stuff.  We remember feeling a lot of pressure -we weren't even
sure if we were a real band.  I remember having conversations like 'What if
Ed finds out that we can't play?' But we hung in there and made a good
record, although, unfortunately, the whole thing was recorded to a click
track so it's pretty stiff.</p>

<p>"I had really high hopes for the two singles off that album, 'Cartoon' and
'Sometime to Return'.  They really captured what the band was trying to
accomplish at that point in time.  I wrote 'Cartoon' one day while I was
sitting in my basement, and it was done in 15 minutes - I didn't even have
to change any of the words.  I don't know what happened.  Usually, I'm so
picky that it takes me forever to write, but that just came piling out one
day.  I was real proud of it and had the highest hopes for it.  But it kind
of landed on deaf ears, I guess.  That's the breaks".</p>

<h2>Clam Dip and Other Delights (Twin/Tone, 1988)</h2>
<p>"Clam Dip was an EP of Hangtime outtakes that we went and re-recorded
because we still had a contractual obligation to Twin/Tone.  Besides, we had
a brilliant concept for the cover art that was a real dig on signing with
A&amp;M.  It totally made fun of them, which in hindsight was probably a very
bad idea.</p>

<p>"A&amp;M's president, Herb Alpert, had been in a band called Herb Alpert and the
Tijuana Brass.  They put out a record called Whipped Cream and Other
Delights which pictured a naked secretary with whipped cream all over her
titties on the cover.  We thought it would be really funny to copy that
cover, but have Karl, our bassist, on the cover instead of the woman - we
copped the graphics and everything.  To us, the whole thing was hysterical,
but maybe A&amp;M didn't share our feelings".</p>

<h2>And the Horse They Rode In On (A&amp;M, 1990)</h2>
<p>"Recording this album marked the beginning of a dark period in our lives.
We were working on the A&amp;M soundstage and fighting with them all the time.
Then they kicked us out in the middle of tracking because they said it was
too loud or something.  It was really a struggle for Steve Jordan, the
producer, to make us concentrate; we had recorded all of the basic tracks
live but were not up to the task of finishing it.  We were just pissy, whiny
guys that no one wanted to listen to because we complained about everything.</p>

<p>"Even though the record didn't come out well -the backing vocals sound like
the Beach Boys or something- there were some really strong songs, and a lot
of the material sounded great live 'Nice Guys Don't Get paid' is a beautiful
song, and I really like 'Grounded' and 'veil of Tears as well."</p>

<h2>Grave Dancers Union (Columbia 1992)</h2>
<p>"Although nobody talked about it at the time, we all knew Grave Dancers
Union was a make or break proposition.  It was our first album for Columbia,
and there was an amazing amount of pressure on us.  While we thought we were
the shit and had always told people that we were the shit, it had never
really panned out:  it was time to be the shit or get off the pot.
Ultimately, I think the record was successful because it was hands-down
better than anything we had previously released.  Michael Bienhorn, who had
previously worked with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, did a great job producing,
even if we ended up not getting along and had a miserable time recording.</p>

<p>"It's weird that now I feel like I have to justify the success of the single
'Runaway Train'.  A lot of people have this misguided notion that you can
write a hit.  Dave didn't write a hit, he just wrote a song.  Someone else
made it a hit".</p>							</div>
