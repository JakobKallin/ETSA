<p>"Runaway Train," a runaway hit two years ago, was a message song about troubled teens that
touched a nervein this country.</p>

<p>It also made stars of Soul Asylum, the grungy Minneapolis veterans who had toiled in relative
obscurity for a decade.</p>

<p>Now they're headlining major venues for the first time in support of their new "Let Your Dim 
Light Shine" album. But the members of Soul Asylum are finding that mainstream
acceptance has its roses - money, name recognition, bigger venues - and its thorns.</p>

<p>The band has been vilified in some quarters of alternative music because its new album, 
already a million-seller, is not the punkish, grungy assemblage some of its fans - and music 
critics - expected.</p>

<p>Instead, it's a sprawling, sometimes folkish collection of confessional ruminations on life, 
love and lethargy in the cyberage. It's less focused than "Grave Dancers Union," the 
1992 album that did a slow burn up the charts on its way to platinum status. But it is more 
eclectic and ambitious.</p>

<p>The first single and lead track, "Misery," is a clever bit of wordplay about the exploitation
of teen angst in the post-Nirvana world - anger as product.</p>

<p>The other 13 songs spin variations on that and similar themes as the band veers from
straightahead '70's rock to rootsy country-folk to lounge-lizard slither to good, 
old-fashioned pop punk.</p>

<p>Bassist Karl Mueller says the band is all too aware of the backlash. He laughs off the term
alternative as a bromide.</p>

<p>"You know what alternative is," he asked indignantly. "Alternative is stuff like Kenny G 
and Michael Bolton. You can hear Pearl Jam and Nirvana and Stone Temple Pilots
on any&hellip;station now."</p>

<p>But the criticisms sting:  "It kind of bugs me, because we stay true to ourselves. We
don't follow trends."</p>


<p>Anyone who's followed the quartet's checkered career knows that. Soul Asylum is not 
a band that stands still very long. They've slowly moved away from the thrashing punk
of their early days, but "Dim Light" proves that they haven't foresaken it, either. 

<p>Mueller's annoyed by the alternative nation's mindset that popularity and success are
somehow criminal.</p>

<p>"If somebody decides that because their 13-year-old neighbor buys our record we're
not cool, I'm sorry. We do what we do because we believe in what we're doing and it's 
what we're going to continue to do," he said.</p>

<p>Soul Asylum didn't hesitate to accept an invitation to perform at the Sept. 2 gala concert
for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Mueller calls the band's inclusion on
a bill ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Snoop Doggy Dogg an "honor."

<p>But the band is more anxious about the possibility of performing there with either Iggy
Pop or Lou Reed, two of punk's most influential forebears. 

<p>"They're guys I've admired and looked up to since I discovered real music," Mueller 
said.</p>

<p>Playing larger venues, however, is a bit of an adjustment for a band used to smoky 
clubs and crummy PA systems. "It's taking a little getting used to," admitted Mueller.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why the band members have invited a bunch of friends to join them on 
this tour, friends like Matthew Sweet, the Jayhawks and Victoria Williams (who's married
to Jayhawks singer Mark Olson). "It's like a community," Mueller said. "If it feels right,
why not do it?"</p>

<p>They're also taking a page from the Lollapalooza and H.O.R.D.E. tour books, bringing 
along a marketplace with merchants and information booths staffed by members of 
various political and social groups.</p>

<p>"We're trying to give people something to do," Mueller said.</p>

<p>"Two years ago when we did the Spin Doctors tour, they had booths, predominantly
Greenpeace. It seemed like a good idea, particularly for things like pro-choice, 
which we're all strongly behind."</p>

<p>Success has taken other tolls on the band. Singer Dave Pirner - who formed the band
in 1982 with Mueller, guitarist Dan Murphy and drummer Grant Young - has been the
butt of jokes for dating movie star Winona Ryder and making other concessions to 
stardom, like answering an invitation to the White House by President Clinton, a 
"Runaway Train" fan.</p>

<p>There have been internal problems as well. Young was dumped before the "Dim Light"
sessions,replaced by the more accomplished Sterling Campbell, who did most of the
drumming on "Grave Dancer's Union."</p>

<p>Mueller is asked about a recent quote from Young criticizing Pirner for taking control of
the band. Pirner writes the bulk of Soul Asylum's material and does all the singing.</p>

<p>"I read that," Mueller replied, deftly evading the question. "It's got to be at least as
hard for (Young) to startfeeling good about this. I hope we all can, some day, like 
each other again."</p>

<p>Success may have shaken things up, but Mueller says Soul Asylum is essentially 
unchanged. They'll still tour relentlessly and write and record what they want, no matter
how popular they are or what the musical fashion of the moment is.</p>

<p>"I don't think," he said, "we could change if we wanted to."</p>							</div>
